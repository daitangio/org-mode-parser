* RELEASE NOTES :releaseNotes:
** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.1.4
Code name: Reika
+ Node v8.0.0 compatibility test
+ Support for basic INCLUDE statement
  Include is very powerful and expressive

** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.1.3                                                
Code name: Beauty

+ Fixed empty header issue
+ Code Cleanup
+ Fixed vows bugs, unit tests works flawless
+ Migration from jade to pug2 (new name of jade)
+ Added optional logging framework (winston)
+ Started evaluting integration with
https://github.com/mooz/org-js/

*** KNOWN MINOR PROBLEMS
On Node 7.x  vows 0.8 fails on some tests (to-html tests). Anyway it seems only a
a problem of unit testing. 



** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.1.2                                                
Code name: Tetzuya

+ Simple html rendering engine. 
  Jade is an optional requirement if you want to use it as template
  engine.  
  It is required on-demand. 
  Anyway we suggest to install it 
+ Support for source block #+begin_src / #+end_src
+ Quickcheck for stronger unit test (only embrional setup)
+ Fixes by contributors:
  1) Support for closed timestamp (thesebas/feature/closed-timestamp)
  2) data-language addition (by guozhen)
  3) [fix] don't parse lien when processing source code (by guozhen)
  4) Style/language pass on README.org (by aviav)
  5) fix typo in README.org (by kevzettler)
  6) fix up tortureTest to not crash the parser in the malformed
     property drawer (by natto)
  7)  Merge branch 'client-side-rendering' into api/extension
      (giorgi + natto)
+ Nodejs 4.x+ required (do not tested below, should work anyway)
+ Added CONTTRIB file

Potential break-change:
Now unknown directive are *retained*

** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.1.1                                                
Republish (0.1.0  never see light)
** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.1.0                                          
+ Visual Studio 2015 compatibility
+ Tested on node v0.12.2
** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.0.9 						
+ API Change: IllegalArgumentException and ParseError disappears. They are replaced with simple Error object
  because in node 0.10.x the toString() of the old objects was wrong.
  /Parsing error are targeted to human beings, so avoid trapping them
  for complex recovery puropse/
** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.0.8 						
+ Added the examples/site-publisher example
+ Tested against latest node version
+ Removed direct dependecy from vows, only used for testing
** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.0.7						
*** Stringent selectSubtree API (BUGFIX).
anOrgQuery.selectSubtree(i)  now will accept only these types of i objects:
 + A Orgnode
 + A 1-size OrgQuery collection
 + empty/null

/Keep in mind the following rule for understanding the behavior:/

q.selectSubtree(emptyNodeList) === q.selectSubtree(null) == q.selectSubtree() === q

which is a bit naif, but it will not break the existing API.

*** Magic avoided
Evaluted the option of omitting first() on mono results, but API gets dirty. 
For play with it, see commit tag dev_orgquery_one_node_merge  (6dd58da5e3a90e3f651bba4949cbe7b95155bc6b)
and serch for the use of the "mergeFrom" method, now disabled.

** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.0.6					  
Minor documentation fixes

** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.0.5					  
1. Addedd support for generic :DRAWER: syntax
2. Archive tag is supported
Missed:
+ links/ Footnotes  are still completly missed
+ Ordered/Bulletin list are still missed, 
  but org-mode will present it in a nice way anyway

** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.0.4 
 1) Added new OrgQuery methods: 
    1. sortBy
    2. reject
    3. toArray
    4. each
 2) :PROPERTIES: without :END: generates an error now.
    The parser is quite weak, but can detect this simple case.
BUGFIXES:
 + OrgQuery had a bug, and collected nodes could not be unique in some rare situations.
   Now we relay on underscore library for generating unique id
 + Added a set of stronger guards on constructors
   
** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.0.3   
  1) Added the ability to regenerate the Orgnode as string using the method
     toOrgString()
     Be carefully, the method is still experimental and do not emit:
      a) Comments
      b) SCHEDULE,DEADLINE and CLOCK directive
  2) Added the OrgQuery object, for doing queries like 
     + subtree extraction with .selectSubtree
     + tag-based searches with selectTag   
Even if the OrgQuery try to play nice, it is not yet an array, so
avoid using it directly with _.each(...)


*** KNOWN LIMITATIONS
  1) Comments are stripped off during parsing.
  2) Special directive starting with '#+' are mostly ignored during the parsing, 
     for instance #+AUTHOR etc
  3) Tables are not parsed at all. 
  4) In org-mode tags cannot have "-" character in name. They are split in subwords. 
     The parser allow this instead, so be careful when editing by hand org files.
  5) properties can have "-" but this will force 
     you to access them with the array syntax instead of the dot notation, so we
     strongly suggest to avoid "-" and special java character in property names.
     Relay on "_", for instance.
     
** ORG_MODE_PARSER_0.0.2 					  
  1) SCHEDULE,DEADLINE and CLOCK directives now are correctly parsed
  2) Added a performance watchdog to track slowdowns
  3) Added the ability to return performance data via makelist
  4) Started restructuring parser for better performance.
  5) Minor API Change: null is the default value for tag,priority,scheduled, deadline 
     when not set.
     e.tags.existingtag is true if existingtag is there.
     Anyway is better to use 
       "existingtag" in e.tags
     which is a better syntax
